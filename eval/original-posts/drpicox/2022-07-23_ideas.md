# Ideas

Usually an idea is worthless, unless they are put in practice.
The same happens in this game. 

With the right idea you can transform some cards into other cards.
Transformations take time, often it is one moon. So you will have to
end the moon.

## You have ideas

In addition to your cards, you can find that you have ideas.

### Looking at your ideas

One of the most basic ideas is harvesting, if you enter to the game
you will see it.

 * Enter the game.
 * There should be the "Harvest" idea.

### Ideas are cards

Well, surprisingly ideas are cards.
Although they are not among your cards:

 * There should be 0 "Harvest Idea" cards.

But you can create cards from ideas.
All you have to do is to draw an Idea card from an idea

 * Draw a card from the "Harvest" idea.

And now you should have an idea card.

 * There should be 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.

### Ideas are several cards

Ideas are not exclusive. 
That means that you can draw several times 
cards from the idea.
So if we draw another card...

 * Given there is the "Harvest" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Draw a card from the "Harvest" idea.
 * There should be 2 "Harvest Idea" cards.

Bingo, we have two cards of the same ideas.

### Removing idea cards

You can discard idea cards at any time.
Just return the card to the idea.

 * Given there are 2 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Discard 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.

## Using ideas

But ideas are useless if you cannot use them
So, let's try to use an idea.

### Reading the idea

Ideas have instructions for what they need. Let's look closer to the "Harvest" idea.

 * Given there is the "Harvest" idea.
 * The "Harvest" idea should require 1 "Fruit Plant" card.
 * The "Harvest" idea should require 1 "Villager" card.

So, it says that it needs 1 "Fruit Plant", and 1 "Villager".
We know what a "Villager" card is, but, do we know what a "Fruit Plant" is?
Maybe the "Berry Bush" is a "Fruit Plant" and it gives "Berry" cards. 

### Stacking cards

To use an idea we need an idea card, and then, place the required cards on top.
It says that it needs 1 "Villager" and 1 "Fruit Plant", so, we need:

 * Given there is the "Harvest" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Villager" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * Given there are 0 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Draw a card from the "Harvest" idea.
 * Stack 1 "Villager" card on top of the "Harvest Idea" card.
 * Stack 1 "Berry Bush" card on top of the "Harvest Idea" card.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.

### Trying ideas

Ideas are placed, and cards stacked, but nothing happens. 
That is because we are in the planning phase, changes actually happens
at the end of the moon. So, once we have the stack, we should end the moon and see what happens.

 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.

So we have one new berries. But wait, did the villager eat its food? Yes!
So in fact harvest gets two berries.

### Order has some importance

What is important, is that all three cards are together, so, if we change the order,
it should work.

 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Villager", 1 "Berry Bush", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Villager", 1 "Berry Bush", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.

Unless, the idea is not the bottom card. Then it does not work.

 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * There should be 0 "Berry" cards.

### Using ideas multiple times

The ides can be used several times, so:

 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 3 "Berry" cards.

So, after two moons, we have accumulated 2 more berries.

### Using the same idea twice

Because we can draw twice an idea, we can create two stacks. So:

 * Given there are 2 stacks of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Given there are 2 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 stack of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 4 "Berry" cards.

We had two villagers eating, so they eat 2 berries, but they produced four berries,
two new berries for each villager.

### Eating comes last

Well, villagers are eager workers, they finish their chores before eating.
So, if you do not have food enough, but you have a bush, you can always get food for them.

 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Given there are 0 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 1 "Berry" cards.

So the villager survived, and eat the berry that was produced. Uf.

### Card Substitutes

Ok, we know that "Villager" can harvest, but it makes reasonable that other cards
may be also likely to harvest, like "Militia":

 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Militia", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Militia", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.

So "Militia" works like "Villager". And what about other cards? What about
"Apple Tree"?

 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Apple Tree", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Apple" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Apple Tree", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 2 "Apple" cards.

And what about mixing them all?

 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Apple Tree", 1 "Militia", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Apple" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Apple Tree", 1 "Militia", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 2 "Apple" cards.

What? An Apple? Yes! Apple trees do Apples, not Berries.

### More cards than necessary

What if we add more cards than necessary?

 * Given there are 1 stacks of 2 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 2 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.

It works. And it even works if there is a different card.

 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Corpse", 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 1 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Corpse", 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.

But it does not work if the three last cards are not the necessary by the idea.

 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Villager", 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Corpse", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 1 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Villager", 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Corpse", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 0 "Berry" cards.

It does not even work if all the cards are the good ones, but the necessary ones ar note close
to the idea card to apply.

 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Villager", 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Apple Tree", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 1 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Villager", 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Apple Tree", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 0 "Berry" cards.

And of course, if there are competing cards, like "Berry Bush" and "Apple Tree", the one that
is applied is the one that is closer to the "Harvest Idea".

 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", 1 "Apple Tree", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 1 "Apple" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", 1 "Apple Tree", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 2 "Apple" cards.

And that is all, for now.
