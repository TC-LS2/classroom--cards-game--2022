# Ideas

Usually an idea is worthless, unless they are put in practice.
The same happens in this game. 

With the right idea you can transform some cards into other cards.
Transformations take time, often it is one moon. So you will have to
end the moon.

## You have ideas

In addition to your cards, you can find that you have ideas.

### Looking at your ideas

One of the most basic ideas is harvesting, if you enter to the game
you will see it.

 * Enter the game.
 * There should be the "Harvest Idea" idea.

### Ideas are cards

Well, surprisingly ideas are cards.
Although they are not among your cards:

 * There should be 0 "Harvest Idea" cards.

But you can create cards from ideas.
All you have to do is to draw an Idea card from an idea

 * Draw a card from the "Harvest Idea" idea.

And now you should have an idea card.

 * There should be 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.

### Ideas are several cards

Ideas are not exclusive. 
That means that you can draw several times 
cards from the idea.
So if we draw another card...

 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Draw a card from the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * There should be 2 "Harvest Idea" cards.

Bingo, we have two cards of the same ideas.

### Removing idea cards

You can discard idea cards at any time.
Just return the card to the idea.

 * Given there are 2 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Discard 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.

## Using ideas

But ideas are useless if you cannot use them
So, let's try to use an idea.

### Reading the idea

Ideas have instructions for what they need. Let's look closer to the "Harvest Idea" idea.

 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * The "Harvest Idea" idea should require the sum of 1 in "Fruit Plant" tag cards.
 * The "Harvest Idea" idea should require the sum of 1 in "Worker" tag cards.

So, it says that it needs cards with a total of 
1 "Fruit Plant", and 1 "Worker" tags.

So, let's see what we have:

 * Given there are 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Villager" cards.
 * The "Berry Bush" card should have 1 in "Fruit Plant" tag.
 * The "Villager" card should have 1 in "Worker" tag.

In addition, we can see that cards have description,
if we look to the description of the "Berry Bush", it would
say that the fruit is the "Berry".

 * Given there are 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * The "Berry Bush" card description should say "Fruit" is "Berry". 

So we know that with a "Berry Bush", that is a "Fruit Plant", and a "Villager",
that is a "Worker", we will have the "Berry" card.

### Stacking cards

To use an idea we need an idea card, and then, place the required cards on top.
It says that it needs 1 "Villager" and 1 "Fruit Plant", so, we need:

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Villager" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * Given there are 0 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Draw a card from the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Move the "Harvest Idea" card to its own stack.
 * Move the "Villager" card on top of the "Harvest Idea" card.
 * Move the "Berry Bush" card on top of the "Villager" card.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.

### Trying ideas

Ideas are placed, and cards stacked, but nothing happens. 
That is because we are in the planning phase, changes actually happens
at the end of the moon. So, once we have the stack, we should end the moon and see what happens.

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.

So we have one new berries. But wait, did the villager eat its food? Yes!
So in fact harvest gets two berries.

### Order has some importance

What is important, is that all three cards are together, so, if we change the order,
it should work.

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Berry Bush", and 1 "Villager" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.

Unless, the idea is not the bottom card. Then it does not work.

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 0 "Berry" cards.

### Using ideas multiple times

The ides can be used several times, so:

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * There should be 3 "Berry" cards.

So, after two moons, we have accumulated 2 more berries.

### Using the same idea twice

Because we can draw twice an idea, we can create two stacks. So:

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 2 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 2 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 4 "Berry" cards.

We had two villagers eating, so they eat 2 berries, but they produced four berries,
two new berries for each villager.

### Eating comes last

Well, villagers are eager workers, they finish their chores before eating.
So, if you do not have food enough, but you have a bush, you can always get food for them.

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 0 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 "Villager" cards.
 * There should be 1 "Berry" cards.

So the villager survived, and eat the berry that was produced. Uf.

### Card Substitutes

Ok, we know that "Villager" can harvest, but it makes reasonable that other cards
may be also likely to harvest, like "Militia" (eats two berries):

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 2 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Militia", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.

So "Militia" works like "Villager". And what about other cards? What about
"Apple Tree"?

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Apple" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Apple Tree" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 "Apple" cards.

And what about mixing them all?

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Apple" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Militia", and 1 "Apple Tree" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 "Apple" cards.

What? An Apple? Yes! Apple trees do Apples, not Berries.

### Idea cards at bottom

The idea cards must be at the bottom, otherwise, they do not work:

  * Given a new game.
  * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
  * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
  * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Berry Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
  * End the current moon.
  * There should be 0 "Berry" cards.

It did not work because the idea was not at the bottom.

### More cards than necessary

What if we add more cards than necessary?

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Corpse", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.

One card has nothing to do with the idea, but it still works.
But, what happens if we have more "Fruit Plant" cards than necessary?

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 2 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.

It seems that nothing changed, but, what if we add more workers?

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 2 "Villager", and 2 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 3 "Berry" cards.

Now both workers harvest fruits. But, what if we have more workers than fruit plants?

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 2 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 "Berry" cards.

The second worker did not worked, and eat its berry.

### Mixing kinds of fruits

We have seen that we can have more cards than necessary,
but what if we want to mix "Berry Bushes" and "Apple Trees"?

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 0 "Apple" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", 1 "Berry Bush", and 1 "Apple Tree" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.
 * There should be 0 "Apple" cards.

The fruit card from the bottom is the "Berry Bush", so we get two "Berry" cards, but no new "Apple" cards.
But, if we put the "Apple Tree" card below:

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 0 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Apple" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", 1 "Apple Tree", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 0 "Berry" cards.
 * There should be 2 "Apple" cards.

So we have an "Apple".

But... what if we have two workers?

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Apple" cards.
 * Given there are 1 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 2 "Villager", 1 "Apple Tree", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 3 "Berry" cards.
 * There should be 2 "Apple" cards.

Both "Villager" have worked, and now both "Fruit Plant" cards have produced fruits.

## XP...
