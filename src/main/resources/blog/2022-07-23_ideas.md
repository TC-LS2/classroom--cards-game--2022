# Ideas

Usually an idea is worthless, unless they are put in practice.
The same happens in this game. 

With the right idea you can transform some cards into other cards.
Transformations take time, often it is one moon. So you will have to
end the moon.

## You have ideas

In addition to your cards, you can find that you have ideas.

### Looking at your ideas

One of the most basic ideas is harvesting, if you enter to the game
you will see it.

 * Enter to the game.
 * There should be the "Harvest" idea.

### Ideas are cards

Well, suprinsingly ideas are cards.
Although they are not among your cards:

 * There should be 0 "Harvest Idea" cards.

But you can create cards from ideas.
All you have to do is to draw an Idea card from an idea

 * Draw a card from the "Harvest" idea.

And now you should have an idea card.

 * There should be 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.

### Ideas are several cards

Ideas are not exclusive. 
That means that you can draw several times 
cards from the idea.
So if we draw another card...

 * Given we are playing a new "empty" game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Draw a card from the "Harvest" idea.
 * There should be 2 "Harvest Idea" cards.

Bingo, we have two cards of the same ideas.

### Removing idea cards

You can discard idea cards at any time.
Just return the card to the idea.

 * Given we are playing a new "empty" game.
 * Given there are 2 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Discard 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.

## Using ideas

But ideas are useless if you cannot use them
So, let's try to use an idea.

### Reading the idea

Ideas have instructions for what they need. Let's look closer to the "Harvest" idea.

 * Given we are playing a new "empty" game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest" idea.
 * The "Harvest" idea should require 1 "Fruit Plant" card.
 * The "Harvest" idea should require 1 "Villager" card.

So, it says that it needs 1 "Fruit Plant", and 1 "Villager".
We know what a "Villager" card is, but, do we know what a "Fruit Plant" is?
Maybe the "Bush" is a "Fruit Plant" and it gives "Berry" cards. 

### Stacking cards

To use an idea we need an idea card, and then, place the required cards on top.
It says that it needs 1 "Villager" and 1 "Fruit Plant", so, we need:

 * Given we are playing a new "empty" game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Villager" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Bush" cards.
 * Draw a card from the "Harvest" idea.
 * Stack 1 "Villager" card on top of the "Harvest Idea" card.
 * Stack 1 "Bush" card on top of the "Harvest Idea" card.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.

### Trying ideas

Ideas are placed, and cards stacked, but nothing happens. 
That is because we are in the planning phase, changes actually happens
at the end of the moon. So, once we have the stack, we should end the moon and see what happens.

 * Given we are playing a new "empty" game.
 * Given there is 1 stack of 1 "Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.

So we have one new berries. But wait, did the villager eat its food? Yes!
So in fact harvest gets two berries.

### Order is not important

What is important, is that all three cards are together, so, if we change the order,
it should work.

 * Given we are playing a new "empty" game.
 * Given there is 1 stack of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Bush" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Bush" cards.
 * There should be 2 "Berry" cards.

### Using ideas multiple times

The ides can be used several times, so:

 * Given we are playing a new "empty" game.
 * Given there is 1 stack of 1 "Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 3 "Berry" cards.

So, after two moons, we have accumulated 2 more berries.

### Using the same idea twice

Because we can draw twice an idea, we can create two stacks. So:

 * Given we are playing a new "empty" game.
 * Given there is 2 stack of 1 "Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Given there are 2 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 2 stack of 1 "Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 4 "Berry" cards.

We had two villagers eating, so they eat 2 berries, but they produced four berries,
two new berries for each villager.

### Eating comes last

Well, villagers are eager workers, they finish their chores before eating.
So, if you do not have food enough, but you have a bush, you can always get food for them.

 * Given we are playing a new "empty" game.
 * Given there is 1 stack of 1 "Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * Given there are 0 "Berry" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Bush", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Harvest Idea" cards.
 * There should be 1 "Berry" cards.

So the villager survived, and eat the berry that was produced. Uf.


It says that we need a "Fruit Plant". Let's look what we have:

* + There should be 1 "Villager" cards, 1 "Berry" cards, and 1 "Bush" cards.

So, we have the "Villager", we have the "Berry" that he needs to ead, but
we have a "Bush". It might be that the bush is a "Fruit Plant"? Let's try it.

+ Place the "Villager" on top of the "Bush" card.
+ There should be 1 stack of "Villager" and "Bush".

And end the moon.

+ End the current moon.

## The result of the idea

Let's look what happened. We know that the Villager have eaten the Berry,
so there should be no berries at all. But we have tried to harvest the bush,
what would be the result? Let's look!

+ There should be 1 "Villager" cards, 2 "Berry" cards, and 1 "Bush" cards.

Wow! Now we have two berries. And the Villager it is on top of the bush:

+ There should be a "Villager" card on top of the "Bush" card.

## Repeating ideas

If we end the moon again, and the villager eats one Berry... there should
be only one left, but because the Villager is on top of the Bush, the
"Harvest" idea should have been activated again.

+ There should be 1 "Villager" cards, 2 "Berry" cards, and 1 "Bush" cards.
+ End the current moon.
+ There should be 1 "Villager" cards, 3 "Berry" cards, and 1 "Bush" cards.

Yes! We have eaten one card, but we have produced two more. So now we have three.

## Changing orders

Let's try something different, now we will place the "Bush" on top of the "Villager" card.

+ There should be a "Villager" card on top of the "Bush" card.
+ Remove "Villager" from the top of the "Bush" card.
+ Place the "Bush" on top of the "Villager" card.
+ There should be a "Bush" card on top of the "Villager" card.

## Ideas work at any order

And let's look if it works.

+ There should be 1 "Villager" cards, 3 "Berry" cards, and 1 "Bush" cards.
+ End the current moon.
+ There should be 1 "Villager" cards, 4 "Berry" cards, and 1 "Bush" cards.

It worked. The idea works, not matter the order.

## Stopping ideas

Both cards together are 1 stack of two cards, and that activates the idea.
If we remove one card from the stack, then the idea stops working.

+ There should be a "Bush" card on top of the "Villager" card.
+ Remove "Bush" from the top of the "Villager" card.
+ There should be no card on top of the "Villager" card.

Le'ts check in. 

+ There should be 1 "Villager" cards, 4 "Berry" cards, and 1 "Bush" cards.
+ End the current moon.
+ There should be 1 "Villager" cards, 3 "Berry" cards, and 1 "Bush" cards.

There is no new berries cards, and villagers are fed. So we have stopped the idea.

## Too big stacks

There is also another question. If you make 1 stack too big, the idea stops
working. For example:

+ Stack 1 "Villager" card, 1 "Bush" card, and 1 "Berry" card.

The "Berry" does not form part of the idea, let's see what happen:

+ There should be 1 stack of "Villager", "Bush" and "Berry".

+ There should be 1 "Villager" cards, 3 "Berry" cards, and 1 "Bush" cards.
+ End the current moon.
+ There should be 1 "Villager" cards, 2 "Berry" cards, and 1 "Bush" cards.

Nothing happened. If there are too many things in the stack, it stops working.

## Ideas have XP

Something curious about ideas, is that the more that you put them in practice,
the more you learn. And then you might discover new things.

Let's look to the current harvest idea:

+ It should have 3 experience points.

Why three? because we have used the idea three times.
 

## Substitutes

Militia is Villager, so we can use a Militia as a Villager.


Nothing happens. 


And we also had the "Villager":

+ There should be 1 "Villager" card.

So it seems that we could use 

We have seen that we have villagers, and we have berries.
It turns out that villagers need food to survive. If not, they die.

Let's see how eating works.

## More kinds of villagers

Villagers eat one food, but there are other cards that eats
more than one. Like Militia, they eat two of food. 
Let's see it:

+ Given there are 1 "Villager" and 1 "Militia" cards.
+ The "Villager" card should have 1 in "eats" tag.
+ The "Militia" card should have 2 in "eats" tag.
+ The sum of all "eats" tags value should be 3.

## More kinds of food

And there are also different kinds of food cards:

+ Given there are 1 "Berry" and 1 "Apple" cards.
+ The "Berry" card should have 1 in "food" tag.
+ The "Apple" card should have 2 in "food" tag.
+ The sum of all "food" tags value should be 3.

## Eating

Eating works as expected, in this case, all villagers eats all available food:

+ End the current moon.
+ The sum of all "eats" tags value should be 3.
+ The sum of all "food" tags value should be 0.

## Too much food

If there is more food than villagers, the additional food is kept for the next moon.

+ Given there are 4 "Berry" and 0 "Apple" cards.
+ The sum of all "eats" tags value should be 3.
+ The sum of all "food" tags value should be 4.
+ End the current moon.
+ The sum of all "eats" tags value should be 3.
+ The sum of all "food" tags value should be 1.
+ There should be 1 "Berry" cards.

But what happens with half cards? could we eat half Apple?

+ Given there are 0 "Berry" and 2 "Apple" cards.
+ The sum of all "eats" tags value should be 3.
+ The sum of all "food" tags value should be 4.
+ End the current moon.
+ The sum of all "eats" tags value should be 3.
+ The sum of all "food" tags value should be 0.
+ There should be 0 "Apple" cards.

There is no Apple card left.

## Too few food

What happens when there are more eaters than food? 
We have already seen that they starve to dead.

But what with half foods? It turns out that they
are polite, and they leave the food untouched.

+ Given there are 0 "Villager" and 2 "Militia" cards.
+ Given there are 3 "Berry" and 0 "Apple" cards.
+ The sum of all "eats" tags value should be 4.
+ The sum of all "food" tags value should be 3.
+ End the current moon.
+ The sum of all "eats" tags value should be 2.
+ The sum of all "food" tags value should be 1.
+ There should be 1 "Militia" cards.
+ There should be 1 "Berry" cards.

So, at least they starve letting the future generations an option.
